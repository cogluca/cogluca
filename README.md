Nice to meet you, I'm Gianluca

- 🌱 Currently I'm working on my front end skills with Javascript, HTML, CSS and React, not doing it on my own, I take advice from senior friends in a community and from Front End Masters courses, so ... nothing to worry, I'm not playing the cowboy eheh.

- ❤️ I love to experiment and build strong foundations regarding the Web on its entirety, honestly I'm aiming at being well versed in the entire stack to be one day able to build entire products on my own (got some perfectionism issues eheh).

- 🔥 I find the creator economy to be lit and I highly value people that chose self expression and freedom as their highest standards, would love to be able to serve them through my technical chops.

- 🧐 Something that I'm deeply interested in is: how will this web3 thing play out, will it fizzle out ? will it define the next 20 years ? Will we live in completely disrupted societies as it has happened with the advent of of dynamic pages, Web2 and mobile technologies ? How will creators navigate this landscape ? Will we all become networked small businesses in a tail end of the market where giants reign supreme as platforms ? So many questions for the future ahead.
